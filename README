This is a monero IRC tipbot.

Installation requirements:
  - monero
  - python
  - redis
  - python-redis

The daemon needs a running redis, bitmonerod and simplewallet. Set the connection parameters
for these in tipbot.py.

Before starting, read the configuration parameters at the top of tipbot.py and change
as appropriate.

The tipbot will need a wallet. Any wallet can do, but it is recommended to use a separate
wallet. This wallet should be loaded in the simplewallet the tipbot connects to.

Tipbot commands are prefix with "!". Try !help to get a list of available commands.

The withdrawal fee is currently set to the default network fee. If a withdraw transaction
happens to be larger than 1 kB, more will be charged by simplewallet. The withdrawal fee
can be set higher to guard against this.

If a withdrawal error happens, withdrawals are disabled until enabled again by the operator,
to avoid possible exploits.
